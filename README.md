# INM705_ObjectDetection
Pytorch Implementation of Object Detector algorithms inspired by the Yolo and Detr architecture

To train, please move VOC file into same directory as code (available on title page of report via Google Drive link)

YOLO model was trained locally on mps. It supports cuda however may be incompatible with Hyperion.
To train DETR model, please install requirements.txt and run 'run_job.sh'.

Model outputs can be observed and visualized by running the eval.py file. Please ensure that model checkpoint is in same directory as eval.py (available on title page of report via Google Drive link).
